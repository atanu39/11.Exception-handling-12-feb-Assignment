    "## In Python, an exception is an error that occurs during the execution of a program. When a Python interpreter encounters an error during runtime, it raises an exception, which is a signal that an error has occurred and the program execution cannot continue as expected. Exceptions can be caused by a wide range of issues, including invalid input, division by zero, and incorrect function arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "## On the other hand, a syntax error is an error that occurs during the parsing of a program, which means that the interpreter cannot understand the code because it violates the rules of the programming language's syntax. A syntax error is typically detected before a program is run, as the interpreter can identify the problem when it tries to compile or parse the code. Syntax errors can include missing brackets, incorrect indentation, or using a keyword as a variable name.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The main difference between an exception and a syntax error is that a syntax error is caused by a mistake in the code itself, whereas an exception is caused by an unexpected problem during program execution. Additionally, syntax errors are typically detected before the program is run, whereas exceptions are only raised during runtime. When an exception is raised, Python provides a traceback that indicates where the error occurred in the program, which can be helpful in identifying and fixing the problem."
